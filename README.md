<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<!--- Step 1 -->
<p>
In this section we're going to create some tickets as if we were the end user (Ken or Karen) and then we're going to recieve the tickets as the Help Desk Professional and then set ticket properties to these tickets.
</p>

<p>
Open a new tab in Microsoft Edge, and use this link: http://localhost/osTicket/. Now use the information for the first user you create (I'm using Karen's) and then select Business Critical Outage as the help topic. Then give a generic issue title/summary and then create the ticket. We're going to do the same thing for the other user (I'm using Ken) and then select Personal Computer Issues, and then give a generic issue title/summary.
